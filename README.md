<h1>  Data Structure With Java and Sorting Algorithms </h1>

![Badge Finished](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20Finished-green)

This project aims to provide a clear visualization of various
data structures and their implementations, as well as including
sorting methods. In order to interactively understand how the
following structures and algorithms work.

## :üî® Functionalities
- `Functionality 1`: Stacks: Ordered list or data structure that allows storing and retrieving data, 
with the access mode to its elements being LIFO type

![ED1](https://github.com/zohan22/DataStructure/assets/66893240/884b44ee-8854-4435-ae7c-5fc81c40da12)
- `Functionality 2`: Queues: List that allows access to data from one of the two ends of the FIFO type list
  
![ED2](https://github.com/zohan22/DataStructure/assets/66893240/73aedc91-7ecd-448b-a94a-8bb7b1073bb2)
- `Functionality 3`: Linked List: Dynamic data structure whose nodes are usually records and which have a fixed size
  
![ED3](https://github.com/zohan22/DataStructure/assets/66893240/4621f24a-7cef-4238-93c8-0841df2beb23)
- `Functionality 4`: Trees: Non-linear data structures that serve to represent hierarchical information structures and addresses or labels in an organized manner
  
![ED4](https://github.com/zohan22/DataStructure/assets/66893240/cf9e14c5-61d8-4dec-8a01-b40f122f214a)
- `Functionality 5`: Graphs: Abstract data types, A graph is a non-empty set of objects or physical entities that have a relationship between them.
  
![ED5](https://github.com/zohan22/DataStructure/assets/66893240/d8ce3308-a2ef-4d30-ac73-04ee0cb01f0b)
- `Functionality 6`: Sorting: Set of instructions that take an array or list as input and arrange the elements in a particular order
