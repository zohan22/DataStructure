<h1>  Data Structure With Java and Sorting Algorithms </h1>

![Badge Finished](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-%20Finished-green)

This project aims to provide a clear visualization of various
data structures and their implementations, as well as including
sorting methods. In order to interactively understand how the
following structures and algorithms work.

## :üî® Functionalities
- `Functionality 1`: Stacks: Ordered list or data structure that allows storing and retrieving data, 
with the access mode to its elements being LIFO type
![ED1.PNG](..%2F..%2FED1.PNG)
- `Functionality 2`: Queues: List that allows access to data from one of the two ends of the FIFO type list
![ED2.PNG](..%2F..%2FED2.PNG)
- `Functionality 3`: Linked List: Dynamic data structure whose nodes are usually records and which have a fixed size
![ED3.PNG](..%2F..%2FED3.PNG)
- `Functionality 4`: Trees: Non-linear data structures that serve to represent hierarchical information structures and addresses or labels in an organized manner
![ED4.PNG](..%2F..%2FED4.PNG)
- `Functionality 5`: Graphs: Abstract data types, A graph is a non-empty set of objects or physical entities that have a relationship between them.
![ED5.PNG](..%2F..%2FED5.PNG)
- `Functionality 6`: Sorting: Set of instructions that take an array or list as input and arrange the elements in a particular order
